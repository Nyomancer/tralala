Tralala IRC Bot

A _very_ simple IRC bot written in Python using twisted.
Work in progress. Expanded as needed. Input appreciated.

Inspired by and code cannibalized from:

"Writing an Markov-Chain IRC Bot with Twisted and Python", tutorial by Eric Florenzano: http://eflorenzano.com/blog/2008/11/17/writing-markov-chain-irc-bot-twisted-and-python/
